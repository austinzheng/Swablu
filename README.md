Swablu
======

The server component for an experimental, lightweight [Internet forum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum) implemented in Clojure, vaguely similar in concept to phpBB or other such packages.

The server will expose endpoints that return JSON data. Part of this project is to build web and iOS clients that can consume these endpoints.
